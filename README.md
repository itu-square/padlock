# Padlock

## Installation

Make sure you have jvm for Java 8 or newer installed (the compiler is
not needed, either for Scala or Java).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:itu-square/padlock.git
cd padlock
./gradlew build
```

The above should compile and run tests (when they appear).  So you can
now modify code and recompile just by `./gradlew`.
